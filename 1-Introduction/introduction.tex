The selection of a blockchain technology for the INTERLACE platform has been a long and difficult process. The challenge has arisen from the wide variety of technologies, architectures, and protocols, from the very rapid rate of innovation in this field, and from the evolving requirements of a future vision for the Sardex platform. This is because, although INTERLACE is only a first attempt at a blockchain-based transactional platform for the Sardex circuit, it should be as compatible as possible with the future vision of the circuit.

The future vision of the Sardex circuit has been difficult to define because it took a long time to understand how the Sardex mutual credit system could scale to global level while remaining faithful to its principles of support for local economies and of reliance on trust between its users. Since the social and the business dimensions are the starting point for the requirements that lead to choice of technology and architecture definition, we adopted a circular and iterative approach that compared what was possible with what is desirable at each step, and slowly evolved the vision as our understanding of the blockchain space and of our own requirements improved. In this short report we cannot go into too much depth, but it is worth addressing what is arguably the central concept for both Sardex and the blockchain: trust.

\section{Sardex, Trust and the Blockchain}
The blockchain is often described as a `trustless' technology, since the distribution of the validation function to many independent nodes, together with cryptographic algorithms, removes the need for a central authority that plays the role of arbiter. Trust in a central authority and bilateral trust between transacting parties are therefore substituted for reliance on a type of technology and protocol. Clearly, such an approach is particularly useful in situations where there is not trust at all between transacting parties.

By contrast, the Sardex circuit relies on trust to a very significant extent. Between the ``sociological'' trust discussed by Sartori and Dini \cite{SartoriDini2016} and the trust in the technology platform lies an ``economic'' type of trust. In particular, Sardex relies on, and reinforces, ``thick trust''.\footnote{Richard Simmons, economist, private communication, 2018} Thick trust has been discussed in the literature in the business context (e.g. \cite{VosselmanMeerKooistra2009}), but for our purposes it is sufficient to define it as the combination of ``Know Your Customer'' with ``Know Their Products''. The role of the Sardex company that runs the circuit, combined with the work of the Sardex brokers, achieves and combines both these components, because it is able to make trust transitive: the circuit members trust the Sardex company and the electronic platform, and in the majority of cases this trust extends to bilateral trust between the transacting parties, making the Sardex circuit a particularly strong and stable trading community.

Why, then, is Sardex interested in the blockchain? For two reasons. First, as the company operations grow beyond Sardinia and Italy to other countries in Europe and beyond they will involve interactions with other circuits whose legal personality, business relationship with Sardex, and proprietary structure may vary along a range of options depending on the context and stakeholders. Therefore, from a functional and organisational point of view it may be more expedient to build in some flexibility at the level of the architecture: for example, each circuit could run a separate node of the blockchain. Second, this organisational flexibility requirement, which is essentially functionalist, is reinforced by the social and cultural requirement of respecting local identities to the extent possible. This is not so much a matter of institutional or governance efficiency as a question of shared values built around reciprocal respect between different communities. We feel it is easier to meet such expectations with an articulated and distributed architecture than through a monolithic platform like Facebook or Google.

\section{Overview of Report}
This brief report provides a high-level discussion of the main blockchain technologies we examined during the course of the project, together with a rationale for choosing Hyperledger as the core component with possible extensions towards Ethereum and Holochain. The discussion in the rest of the report assumes familiarity with the basic concepts and terminology of the main blockchain technologies as can be found, for example, in \cite{TascaEtAl2017}.

Chapter \ref{ch:dlt} discusses a few candidate Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) that we assessed in the process of deciding which satisfied the INTERLACE and Sardex requirements best. The next step in the process was going to be an ASIM specification and CoreASIM modelling of the transactional platform, which would have been reported in a third chapter, but lack of funding complementary to INTERLACE made this plan impossible. We therefore decided that it made more sense to focus the remaining time and resources on implementing the transactional platform based on the requirements specified in deliverable D2.1 \cite{INTERLACE_D21} and updated in deliverable D3.1 \cite{INTERLACE_D31}. The implementation work is reported in deliverable D3.2.
